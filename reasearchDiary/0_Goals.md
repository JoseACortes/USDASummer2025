My Goals this semester

April 23 2025

- Publish
    publish a paper on the research I did

- Present
    present my research at a conference: poster, slides, a youtube video

- Contribute
    contribute to a open source project, make each of my projects open source and replicable


# 1. Data Considerations

MCNP Datasets for 5 tasks: (based off what my USDA scientist requests)
1. Comparing Analysis Methods
2. Compare Analysis over Depth
3. Compare Core Harvesting Methods with Spectral Analysis
4. Mapping Methods
5. Testing Scanning Amounts

# 2. Paper-Presentation-Poster-Video Topics

1. Spectrum Convolution For Detector Simulation
2. Analysis Methods for Mobile Spectral Analysis
3. Core Harvesting Methods vs Spectral Analysis

# 3. Steps

1. Generate Pure Spectrums
2. Verify Effective Map
3. Verify Fast Spectrum Convolution
4. Compare Analysis Methods
5. Variance Study
6. Depth Study
7. Core Harvesting Comparison (local)
8. Mapping Comparison

# 4. Replicability

Every step is automated and documented
A tool is created to do each step
