	abstract = {This tutorial is intended for those in the environmental field who perform assessments in areas where there is radioactive contamination in the surface soil. Techniques will be introduced for performing on-site quantitative measurements of gamma radiation in the environment using high resolution germanium detectors. A basic understanding of ionizing radiation principles is assumed; however, a detailed knowledge of gamma spectrometry systems is not required. Emphasized is the practical end of operations in the field and the conversion of measured full absorption peak count rates in a collected spectrum to meaningful radiological quantities, such as the concentration of a radionuclide in the soil, activity per unit area, and dose rate in the air. The theory of operation and calibration procedures will be covered in detail to provide the necessary knowledge to adapt the technique to site-specific problems. Example calculations for detector calibration are also provided.},

	abstract = {All currently applied methods for soil moisture measurement and mapping in agricultural fields are labor-intensive and time-consuming. The Pulsed Fast Thermal Neutron Analysis (PFTNA) method, described in this article, can provide in situ soil moisture distribution data across agricultural fields by field scanning with a mobile PFTNA system in a reasonably short time. This method is based on acquiring soil gamma ray responses when irradiated by fast neutrons. The response gamma spectra [thermal neutron capture (TNC) gamma spectra] contain the gamma ray peak related to hydrogen present in soil. Since the majority of hydrogen is contained in soil water, soil moisture can be determined from the value of the hydrogen peak area in TNC spectra. A power dependency with a non-zero constant term was used to convert the hydrogen peak area to soil moisture content. To create this dependency, the hydrogen peak area in the TNC spectra was plotted against moisture data obtained using other methods (gravimetric, time domain reflectometry, nuclear radiation transmission) in the same agricultural fields. Developed methods for PFTNA field scanning and data processing provided data for moisture mapping; this scanning method involved moving at 5 km h−1, simultaneously recording GPS coordinates and TNC gamma spectra every 30 s, and scanning paths that uniformly covered surveyed fields. Comparison of these maps with those created using data from traditional soil moisture measurement methods (gravimetric, time domain reflectometry, nuclear radiation transmission) demonstrated good agreement. Note that PFTNA scanning of a 20-hectare field can acquire the data needed for mapping in approximately one hour. Thus, PFTNA scanning can be recommended as a more efficient method for measuring and mapping soil moisture in agricultural fields.},

	abstract = {The herein described inelastic neutron scattering (INS) method of measuring soil carbon was based on a new procedure for extracting the net carbon signal (NCS) from the measured gamma spectra and determination of the average carbon weight percent in the upper ∼8-cm soil layer (AvgCw\%8). The NCS extraction utilized the net-INS spectrum, which was the difference between the INS and thermal neutron capture (TNC) spectra and the net-INS system background spectrum. The proportionality between NCS and AvgCw\%8 for any shape of soil carbon depth distribution was demonstrated theoretically. The theoretical model for NCS calculations accounted for carbon depth distribution and neutron and gamma ray propagation laws in our analysis; previous model results were verified by comparison with a Monte Carlo simulation using Geant4. The experimental results confirmed the identified proportionality. The mobile INS system was calibrated using pits filled with synthetic soil; this calibration was used for AvgCw\%8 determinations in INS field measurements. The AvgCw\%8 was also determined by the dry combustion method. Benchmarking the soil carbon determination by INS demonstrated results that coincided with dry combustion technique (DCT) results (within experimental error limits). Given the agreement between these methods, the described INS measurement system can be recommended as a reliable alternative means for measuring soil carbon.},

The main parts of the INS system are a pulsed neutron generator, NaI(Tl) gamma detectors, split electronics to separate gamma spectra due to INS and thermo-neutron capture (TNC) processes, and software for gamma spectra acquisition and data processing. This method has several advantages over other methods in that it is a non-destructive in situ method that measures the average carbon content in large soil volumes, is negligibly impacted by local sharp changes in soil carbon, and can be used in stationary or scanning modes. The result of the INS method is the carbon content from a site with a footprint of approximately 2.5 - 3 m2 in the stationary regime, or the average carbon content of the traversed area in the scanning regime. The measurement range of the current INS system is greater than 1.5 carbon weight % (standard deviation ± 0.3 w%) in the upper 10 cm soil layer for a 1 h measurement.},

	abstract = {In this study we tested the combination of two proximal sensors –an electromagnetic conductivity meter (EMI) and a gamma-ray detector– to estimate the variability of some soil properties. The hypothesis was that the employment of data fusion techniques would provide a more comprehensive description of soil texture and soil organic carbon (SOC) content compared to using single sensors alone. This approach aimed to capture a spectrum of characteristics across various mineral and organic alluvial soils. Field surveys covering more than 60 ha were conducted in 2019 on five agricultural experimental sites, whose texture ranged from silty-clay to silty- and sandy-loam and SOC from 0.5 % to 21.9 %. A total of 354 undisturbed soil samples (0–30 cm) was collected and soil properties such as granulometry, bulk density and SOC concentration and stock determined. The fusion of proximal sensing data of apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and gamma-ray radionuclides (total counts –TC–, 238U, 232Th, 40K) combined with multivariate analysis was applied to describe soil spatial variability. Partial leas square regression (PLSR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were trained and tested to predict the variability in soil properties within and between sites. Results showed that data fusion captured the soil spatial variability within and between fields, with a predictive ability (test set) to explain up to 88 % of clay and 74 % of SOC stock variability when all mineral soils were embedded in the ANN model. The combination of TC and ECa was particularly effective in explaining texture and SOC heterogeneity within and across fields. In contrast, different responses were observed for single radionuclides, either 238U, 232Th, 40K, or their ratios, within each field, that likely identified site-specific radioisotope enrichment and/or depletion processes. In conclusion, data fusion of EMI and gamma-ray detectors accurately predicted soil texture and SOC across soils from alluvial origin.},

	abstract = {Gamma ray spectroscopy data acquired by Lunar Prospector are used to determine global maps of the elemental composition of the lunar surface. Maps of the abundance of major oxides, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, CaO, TiO2, and FeO, and trace incompatible elements, K and Th, are presented along with their geochemical interpretation. Linear spectral mixing is used to model the observed gamma ray spectrum for each map pixel. The spectral shape for each elemental constituent is determined by a Monte Carlo radiation transport calculation. Linearization of the mixing model is accomplished by scaling the spectral shapes with lunar surface parameters determined by neutron spectroscopy, including the number density of neutrons slowing down within the surface and the effective atomic mass of the surface materials. The association of the highlands with the feldspathic lunar meteorites is used to calibrate the mixing model and to determine backgrounds. A linear least squares approach is used to unmix measured spectra to determine the composition of each map pixel. The present analysis uses new gamma ray production cross sections for neutron interactions, resulting in improved accuracy compared to results previously submitted to the Planetary Data System. Systematic variations in lunar composition determined by the spectral unmixing analysis are compared with the lunar soil sample and meteorite collections. Significant results include improved accuracy for the abundance of Th and K in the highlands; identification of large regions, including western Procellarum, that are not well represented by the sample collection; and the association of relatively high concentrations of Mg with KREEP-rich regions on the lunar nearside, which may have implications for the concept of an early magma ocean.},
