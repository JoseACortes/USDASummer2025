	abstract = {In many applications, low resolution gamma-ray spectrometers, such as sodium iodide scintillation detectors, are widely used primarily due to their relatively low cost and high detection efficiency. There is widespread interest in improved methods for analyzing spectral data acquired with such devices, using inverse analysis. Peak means and peak areas in gamma- and X-ray spectra are needed for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. This paper introduces the PEAKSI code package that was developed at the Center for Engineering Applications of Radioisotopes (CEAR). The basic approach described here is to use accurate forward models and iterative convolution instead of direct deconvolution. Rather than smoothing and differentiation a combination of linear regression and non-linear searching is used to minimize the reduced chi-square, since this approach retains the capability of establishing uncertainties in the estimated peak parameters. The PEAKSI package uses a Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) non-linear search method combined with multiple linear regression (MLR) to minimize the reduced chi-square value for fitting single or multiple overlapping peaks to determine peak parameters, including peak means, peak standard deviations or full width at half maximum (FWHM), net peak counts, and background counts of peaks in experimental gamma-ray spectra. This approach maintains the natural error structure so that parameter uncertainties can be estimated. The plan is to release this code to the public in the near future.},

	abstract = {Gamma spectroscopy in environments with fluctuating temperatures, magnetic fields, and radiation doses can lead to inaccurate material analysis and increased radiation exposure for workers. In this manuscript, we propose a deep learning model that reduces human intervention and remains robust against variables in uncontrolled environments, thereby enhancing the applicability of gamma spectroscopy in the field. The process of establishing a dataset to train, validate, and test the deep learning model involved simultaneous consideration of multiple variables, including gain shifts, detector energy resolutions, the number of mixed radioisotopes (RIs), mixed RI ratios, and statistical fluctuations of the spectrum. The model was trained using multi-label learning to perform RI identification and quantification simultaneously. Specifically, the RI quantification output of our model structure was designed to predict full-energy peak areas and mixed ratios for each RI. Highlighting the importance of a high-performance training dataset, the training and validation results of the gamma spectroscopy model were analyzed in depth. In the test results, organized by RI type and number of mixed RIs, the model demonstrated that following: even under complex conditions with multiple variables, all outcomes for RI identification and quantification were predicted with high accuracy and precision, exceeding 98\%.},

	abstract = {All currently applied methods for soil moisture measurement and mapping in agricultural fields are labor-intensive and time-consuming. The Pulsed Fast Thermal Neutron Analysis (PFTNA) method, described in this article, can provide in situ soil moisture distribution data across agricultural fields by field scanning with a mobile PFTNA system in a reasonably short time. This method is based on acquiring soil gamma ray responses when irradiated by fast neutrons. The response gamma spectra [thermal neutron capture (TNC) gamma spectra] contain the gamma ray peak related to hydrogen present in soil. Since the majority of hydrogen is contained in soil water, soil moisture can be determined from the value of the hydrogen peak area in TNC spectra. A power dependency with a non-zero constant term was used to convert the hydrogen peak area to soil moisture content. To create this dependency, the hydrogen peak area in the TNC spectra was plotted against moisture data obtained using other methods (gravimetric, time domain reflectometry, nuclear radiation transmission) in the same agricultural fields. Developed methods for PFTNA field scanning and data processing provided data for moisture mapping; this scanning method involved moving at 5 km h−1, simultaneously recording GPS coordinates and TNC gamma spectra every 30 s, and scanning paths that uniformly covered surveyed fields. Comparison of these maps with those created using data from traditional soil moisture measurement methods (gravimetric, time domain reflectometry, nuclear radiation transmission) demonstrated good agreement. Note that PFTNA scanning of a 20-hectare field can acquire the data needed for mapping in approximately one hour. Thus, PFTNA scanning can be recommended as a more efficient method for measuring and mapping soil moisture in agricultural fields.},

	abstract = {In-situ soil carbon measurements would be beneficial when assessing carbon (C) sequestration practices and associated C credits. Neutron gamma analysis, which registers gamma rays that appear due to neutron irradiation, is a tool that can be used for such assessments. However, questions regarding post-effects of neutron irradiation on soil remain unexplored. Temporal post-irradiation effects (neutron flux 2⋅107 neutron/s, neutron energy 14 MeV) on soil chemical and physical attributes were investigated using a previously constructed pulsed fast-thermal neutron-gamma analysis system. Neutron and gamma dose rate distributions during stationary irradiation using this system and Monte-Carlo computer simulations were found to be in agreement; a stationary 1 h irradiation period (conservative or worse-case scenario) was utilized in these scenarios. Physical effects of activating new radioactive isotopes were experimentally determined by assessing changes in the post-irradiated soil gamma spectra (“hot background”) over time; additional soil radioactivity decreased to natural background levels within ∼1 h. Radiolytic decomposition estimates of soil water and soil organic material (primarily cellulosic residue), based on received dose loads and known radiation-chemical yields of water and organic material, were practically negligible. Results indicate that adsorbed radiation doses in scanning mode would be 500 to 1000 times less than in static mode. Thus, neutron gamma analysis does not impact physicochemical aspects of soil health and can be used for soil elemental content determinations without additional radiation safety concerns.},

The introduction covers general principles, different modifications of neutron-gamma analysis, measurement system configuration, and advantages of this method for soil carbon analysis. Problems with neutron-gamma technology in soil carbon analysis and methods of investigations including Monte-Carlo simulation of neutron interaction with soil elements are discussed further. Based on the investigation results, a method of extracting the “soil carbon net peak” from the raw acquired data was developed. The direct proportional dependency between the carbon net peak area and average carbon weight percent in the upper 10 cm soil layer for any carbon depth profile was shown. Calibration of the measurement system using sand-carbon pits and field measurements of soil carbon are described. Measurement results compared to chemical analysis (dry combustion) data demonstrated good agreement between the two methods. Thus, neutron-stimulated gamma ray analysis can be used for in situ determination of near-surface soil carbon content and is applicable for precision geospatial mapping of soil carbon.},

Since SOC content of soils cannot be easily measured, a key barrier to implementing programmes to increase SOC at large scale, is the need for credible and reliable measurement/monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) platforms, both for national reporting and for emissions trading. Without such platforms, investments could be considered risky. In this paper, we review methods and challenges of measuring SOC change directly in soils, before examining some recent novel developments that show promise for quantifying SOC. We describe how repeat soil surveys are used to estimate changes in SOC over time, and how long-term experiments and space-for-time substitution sites can serve as sources of knowledge and can be used to test models, and as potential benchmark sites in global frameworks to estimate SOC change. We briefly consider models that can be used to simulate and project change in SOC and examine the MRV platforms for SOC change already in use in various countries/regions. In the final section, we bring together the various components described in this review, to describe a new vision for a global framework for MRV of SOC change, to support national and international initiatives seeking to effect change in the way we manage our soils.},

	abstract = {We analyze a trust region version of Newton's method for bound-constrained problems. Our approach relies on the geometry of the feasible set, not on the particular representation in terms of constraints. The convergence theory holds for linearly constrained problems and yields global and superlinear convergence without assuming either strict complementarity or linear independence of the active constraints. We also show that the convergence theory leads to an efficient implementation for large bound-constrained problems.},
