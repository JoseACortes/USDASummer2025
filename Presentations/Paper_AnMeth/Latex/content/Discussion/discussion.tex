\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Conclusions}

The study demonstrates the potential of spectral analysis methods for measuring soil carbon levels. Peak fitting and component fitting methods show the best performance, while deep learning techniques require further refinement. Convolution is beneficial for improving the accuracy of spectral analysis.

The peak fitting method with exponential falloff baseline achieved the highest accuracy, suggesting that proper baseline correction is crucial for effective spectral analysis. Component analysis methods provide a good balance between accuracy and interpretability, making them suitable for practical applications.

\subsection{Future Work}

Future work will focus on:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimization of deep learning architectures for spectral analysis
\item Investigation of hybrid methods combining multiple analysis techniques
\item Field validation of the proposed methods
\item Extension to other soil properties beyond carbon content
