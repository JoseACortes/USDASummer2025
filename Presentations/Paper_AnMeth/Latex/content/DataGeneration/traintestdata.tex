\subsection{Training and Testing Data}

The training data for the NGSA methods is picked from the edge cases of the simulated data. This includes the highest and lowest carbon levels both as would be found in simulation as well as natural soils. The testing data is all cases of the simulated data, excluding the training data. The data also ranges from 0\% to 80\% moisture content.
