\section{Introduction}

Soil carbon is a key component of soil health and plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. Accurate measurement of carbon is essential for measuring soil quality, and its impact on the environment \cite{lal_soil_2018} Traditional methods for measuring carbon are often time-consuming, expensive, and require laboratory analysis \cite{de_ros_advancing_2025}. In situ spectral analysis offers an alternative for rapid and non-destructive measurement of soil carbon \cite{yakubova_tagged_2019}.  
This paper explores the use of NGSA techniques to measure carbon levels in various soil types. We simulate in MCNP6.2 common soil types and apply different NGSA methods, including peak fitting, component fitting, singular value decomposition, and deep learning, to evaluate their effectiveness in measuring soil carbon.
