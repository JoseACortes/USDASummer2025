\section{Analysis Methods of Spectral Readings}

This section explores various spectral analysis methods applied to the simulated spectral readings. Each method is evaluated for its effectiveness in measuring Carbon levels. Error is calculated using mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and actual carbon levels in the test data.
