This presentation summarizes how MCNP is used to design detection tools for soil carbon measurements. In-situ spectroscopy is used to measure Soil Organic Carbon as an alternative to soil core harvest methods [1].

Like FMESH tallies, an MCNP cell is cut into a mesh of cells. The cells are used to measure the range of the detection system, and to approximate samples with dimensionally dependent characteristics. Respectively, these features are utilized to optimize the detection architecture and to better model in-situ soil.
