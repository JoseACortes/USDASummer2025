This presentation summarizes how MCNP is used to design detection tools for soil carbon measurements. In-situ spectroscopy is used to measure Soil Organic Carbon as an alternative to soil core harvest methods [1].  

Like FMESH tallies, an MCNP cell is cut into a mesh of cells. The cells are used to measure the range of the architecture of a detection system, and to approximate samples with dimensionally dependent characteristics. Respectively, these features are utilized to configure the detection architecture and to better model in-situ soil.
