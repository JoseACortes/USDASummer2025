In the summer of 2024, Andres finished a software for spectral analysis. This included a web based gui. He then used this to determine the optimal placement of the neutron emmitter in the MINS architecture. He presented the software and its use at the USDA internship presentations, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory MCNP Conference.

In the fall of 2024, Andres introduced digitally functionalized soil samples. This facilitates simulating the MINS over complicated soil. The MINS was presented at the 2024 MathPosium hosted by the Math Department

In the winter of 2024, Andres expanded simulation capabilities to include whole feilds by fitting prior data to simple functions. This in oder to compare accuraccy between MINS and Soil harvest methods.

In the Spring of 2025, Andres wrote code to directly compare the accuracy of different analysis methods, including textbook and novel methods for spectral analysis. The findings of this comparison were presented at Discover 2025, a UTA Conference, then later in his diagnostic doctoral presentation.

Currently, Andres is expanding the datasets to include simulations of common soil types
Also augmenting the simulations to find a accurate measure of the detectors range.

The previous and new studies will be applied on the expanded dataset, so that the results may be published.

All code is shared with the USDA.
