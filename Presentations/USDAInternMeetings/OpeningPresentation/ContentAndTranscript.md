*Good Morning everyone! My name is Jose Andres Cortes, This will be my third summer with the USDA. I am currently a PhD student here at the math department, funded as a GRA by the USDA.*

# Meet the team

*I am working with Dr Korzeniowski Dr. Tobert, Dr. Galina and Dr Kravetski on the MINS project, which is a project that uses gamma spectroscopy to measure soil carbon content in the field. This is the machine we're working on, this is me next to the machine when I went to visit the lab in Auburn, Alabama. The machine is called MINS, which stands for Mobile In Situ Spectroscopy.*

# Development

*The physical machine and is being developed and tested by the USDA, I am responsible for providing mathematical and statistical support for the project. My work has mainly focused on two areas:*

# Simulation:

*First, simulation of the MINS machine using Monte Carlo methods. We use a Monte Carlo code called MCNP, which is a code that simulates the interaction of neutrons and gamma rays with matter. With this we simulate the MINS results, and predict the performance of the machine in different scenarios.*

# Recent work in Simulation:

*My most recent work on this area was to introduce functionalized soil samples. Before we would simulate the tested sample as chemically even, but ive written code that allows us to simulate the tested sample as a function of spatial dimensions. This expands the data to more realistic samples.*

# Analysis:

*The second area of my work is the analysis of the data obtained from the MINS. My work last year was focused on analysis methods for the spectrum that the machine records.*

# Goals:

*My scientists have asked me to focus on the following goals for this summer:*

1. Develop and evaluate mathematical methods for analyzing with new machine architecture.
2. Detection Range (Depth) study of the MINS machine.
3. Comparison of MINS and soil core measurements.
4. Mapping the results of the machine onto a field.
5. Estimation of the impact of the surface area sampled on field measurements.


# Steps:

*I have broken down my work into the following steps:*

1. Generate Pure Spectrums (Spectrum Gneration)
2. Generate Effective Map (Associative Map)
3. Try Fast Spectrum Convolution (Spectrum Generation)
4. Compare Analysis Methods (Apply previous code to new data)
5. Variance Study
6. Depth Study
7. Core Harvesting Comparison (local)
8. Mapping Comparison
9. Field Coverage Study

# First Steps:

*I have already completed the first and seccond step, which was data augmentation, including a map of how the sample is scanned. This achives the goal of measuring range, and I hope to use it for a digital twin idea*


# Social Media:

*Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn, or teams. I love talking about research. I also run the Pickardy Hall discord server for grad students, feel free to join us there. Any questions, comments concerns? Cool, thank you*
