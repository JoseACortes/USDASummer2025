# Intro

*Good Morning everyone! My name is Jose Andres Cortes, This will be my third summer with the USDA. I am currently a PhD student here at the math department, funded as a GRA by the USDA.*

# Meet the team

*I am working with Dr Korzeniowski Dr. Tobert, Dr. Galina and Dr Kravetski on the MINS project, which is a project that uses gamma spectroscopy to measure soil carbon content in the field. This is the machine we're working on, this is me next to the machine when I went to visit the lab in Auburn, Alabama. The machine is called MINS, which stands for Mobile In Situ Spectroscopy.*

# Development

*The physical machine and is being developed and tested by the USDA, I am responsible for providing mathematical and statistical support for the project. My work has mainly focused on two areas:*

# Simulation:

*First, simulation of the MINS machine using Monte Carlo methods. We use a Monte Carlo code called MCNP, which is a code that simulates the interaction of neutrons and gamma rays with matter, this is national code written for nuclear engineers, written on top of fortran. This allows us to simulate the MINS machine and its results, as well as predict the performance of the machine in different scenarios.*

# Recent work in Simulation:

*My most recent work on this area was to introduce functionalized soil samples. Before we would simulate the tested sample as homogeneous, but ive written code that allows us to simulate the tested sample as a function of spatial dimensions. This allows us to simulate the machine with more realistic samples.*

# Analysis:

*The second area of my work is the analysis of the data obtained from the MINS machine. My previous work was focused on the application and augmentation of analysis methods for the spectrum that the machine records.*

# Goals:

*My scientists have asked me to focus on the following goals for this summer:*

1. Develop and evaluate mathematical methods for analyzing with new machine architecture.
2. Detection Range (Depth) study of the MINS machine.
3. Comparison of MINS and soil core measurements.
4. Mapping the results of the machine onto a field.
5. Estimation of the impact of the surface area sampled on field measurements.


# Steps:

*I have broken down my work into the following steps:*

1. Generate Pure Spectrums (Spectrum Gneration)
2. Generate Effective Map (Associative Map)
3. Try Fast Spectrum Convolution (Spectrum Generation)
4. Compare Analysis Methods (Apply previous code to new data)
5. Variance Study
6. Depth Study
7. Core Harvesting Comparison (local)
8. Mapping Comparison
9. Field Coverage Study


# Paper-Presentation-Poster-Video Topics

*Here are some of the topics I am considering for my paper, presentation, poster and video:*

1. Spectrum Convolution For Detector Simulation
2. Analysis Methods for Mobile Spectral Analysis
3. Core Harvesting Methods vs Spectral Analysis
