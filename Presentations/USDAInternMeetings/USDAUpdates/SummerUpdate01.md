Hello All,
Here are the updates for May 27 2025:

1. **Step 1: Spectrum Generation**
   - I have successfully generated spectrums measuring common soil types. I have attached the simulations and resulting spectra in this email.

2. **Step 2: Effective Map Generation**
    - The soil samples have been simulated with functionalized soil, at a resolution of 7x7x7. meaning the soil is divided into 343 cells. This allows us to measure the contribution of each cell to the deposition of particles in the detector.

    - I have generated the effective map for the MINS machine, which shows the range of the machine. This answers the question of how deep the machine can measure given a sample and architecture, and will be used later in a depth study.

3. **Step 3: Fast Spectrum Convolution - Digital Twin**
   - My next step is to see if i can use this to work on Fast Spectrum Convolution, which would allow us to quickly generate spectrums for different sample mixtures. This will be used to create a digital twin of the MINS machine, which might allow for rapid predictions of MINS spectra.
